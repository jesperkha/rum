## About

Rum is a terminal editor made for the Windows terminal, using the win32 console API. It has no other dependencies than libc and win32, making it very lightweight (~50kb). See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) and [changelog.md](changelog.md) for progress on development.

Build with make. Usage: `rum [filename]`

**Note:** When moving the executable to another location, make sure you copy the `config` directory along with it.

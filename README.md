## About

Wim is a soon-to-be vim-like terminal editor made for the Windows terminal, using the win32 console API. Wim has no other dependencies than libc and win32. See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for progress on development.

Build with make. Usage: `wim [filename]`

**Note:** When moving the executable to another location, make sure you copy the `runtime` directory along with it.

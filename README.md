## About

Rum is a fast and minimal editor that supports syntax highlighting, search, split buffers, tabs and much more! It is specifically made for the windows terminal using the win32 console API. It has no other dependencies than libc and win32, making it very lightweight (~60kb) and easy to build! See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) and [changelog.md](changelog.md) for progress on development.

## Installation

Download a [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/jesperkha/rum/releases)

or build from source (gcc required, no dependencies!)

```
git clone https://github.com/jesperkha/rum.git
cd rum
make release
```

**Note:** When moving the executable to another location, make sure you copy the `config` directory along with it.

## Controls
